🧭 Two Different “Ranking Systems”
Layer	Who’s Ranking	What It Cares About
Traditional SEO (Google)	Search Engine	Keywords, backlinks, engagement, site structure
LLM Surfacing (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude)	AI Retrieval System	Semantic depth, authority signals, factual clarity, recency, formatting

You need to satisfy both.

⚙️ 1. What Google / Bing / SEO Still Looks For

(So your site gets traffic)

Topical Authority

Do you have dozens of posts around one subject (e.g. “yacht insurance”)?

Google now ranks clusters of expertise, not one-off posts.

Search Intent Alignment

Are you answering what the user really wants?

Example: someone searches “yacht claim denied” — they want why and what to do, not history of insurance.

User Behavior

Bounce rate, time-on-page, return visitors.

Google watches dwell time closely.

Backlinks & Mentions

Still powerful, but quality > quantity.

A single link from Boat International beats 100 random blogs.

E-E-A-T → Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trust

Use a real author bio with maritime credentials.

Cite actual manuals, case data, or AI testing (adds credibility signals).

Technical SEO

Fast site (<2s load).

Mobile-optimized.

Clear internal links.

Schema markup (FAQ, Article, Product, etc).

✅ TL;DR: SEO bots love clarity, structure, and topical focus.

🤖 2. What LLMs like ChatGPT / Perplexity / Claude Look For

(So your site gets referenced, cited, or summarized)

These models don’t “rank pages” like Google — they ingest or reference web content based on quality signals and retrievability.

Key factors:

Structured Knowledge

LLMs love lists, definitions, and tables — easy to parse semantically.

Use bullet points, bold terms, “X vs Y” comparisons.

Self-Contained Answers

If your page fully answers a query without needing 3 clicks, it’s more likely to be summarized in AI search results.

E.g., “AI for Yacht Insurance — Complete 2025 Guide” that answers FAQs inline.

Explicit Entities

Models rely on entity linking (proper nouns like CelesteOS, Lloyd’s Register, MTU engines).

Mention them in consistent, factual ways.

Metadata Clarity

<title> and <meta description> should sound like Q&A titles:

“How AI Prevents Yacht Insurance Claim Denials | MyYachtsInsurance”

That helps both Google and LLM summarizers.

Recency & Freshness

ChatGPT and Perplexity crawl for updated content.

Refresh dates and update posts monthly.

Semantic Density, Not Keyword Stuffing

LLMs don’t care about repeated keywords.

They care about topic coverage — how many related concepts appear.

Example: instead of repeating “yacht insurance” 20 times, mention related entities:
“P&I clubs, underwriters, class surveyors, downtime costs, AI claim modeling.”

✅ TL;DR: LLMs reward clarity, structured data, entity richness, and factual tone.

🧱 3. Basic Principles to Build On
Principle	Human Benefit	Machine Benefit
Write for understanding, not density	Keeps humans reading	Improves semantic coverage
Answer one question per section	Readable and scannable	Helps LLM chunk content cleanly
Use real yacht terms & examples	Builds trust	Improves vector relevance
Update timestamps and references	Feels current	Signals freshness for AI models
Avoid clickbait / fluff	Keeps trust	Reduces low-confidence scoring
💡 Final Rule of Thumb

SEO = speak human clearly.
LLM visibility = structure knowledge clearly.

If you publish “AI explains why your yacht claim was denied (with data examples)”
→ Google ranks it because it’s topical and well-formatted.
→ ChatGPT references it because it’s semantically complete and factual.
